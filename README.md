## Project Overview
This project explores patterns in child health and wellbeing using a real-world style dataset collected from schools, clinics, and community programmes.  
The focus is on structured data entry, robust cleaning, feature engineering, and clear visual insights to support data-driven decision-making in NGO and educational settings.

---

## Tools & Workflow
 **Microsoft Excel**  
  • Data cleaning and formatting  
  • Feature engineering (Age groups, Attendance categories, Checkup status)  
  • Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts  
 **PowerPoint & PDF**  
  • Visual storytelling  
  • Structured report delivery  
 **GitHub**  
  • Version control and documentation

---

## Project Structure
- **Raw data:** Original dataset as received
- **Cleaned data:** Standardised and validated fields
- **Modified data:** Engineered analytical fields (Age Group, Attendance Category, Checkup Status)
- **Processed data:** Analysis-ready dataset used for visualisations
- **Visuals:** Key charts exported from Excel
- **Portfolio:** Final presentation and PDF summary

---

## Data Workflow
### 1. Raw Data
- Original dataset as received
- No transformations applied

### 2. Cleaned Data
- Removal of duplicates
- Standardised date and percentage formats
- Addressed missing values using appropriate methods
- Corrected inconsistencies across records
  
### 3. Modified Data (Feature Engineering)
- Created analytical fields to support segmentation and comparison:
  - Age Group categories
  - Attendance rate bands
  - Health checkup status indicators

### 4. Processed Data
- Final analysis-ready dataset
- Used to create pivot tables, pivot charts, and visual insights
  

## Key Analysis Areas
- Attendance rates and well-being outcomes
- Data integrity through completeness
- Health checkup coverage
- Correlations between attendance, performance, and well-being

---

## Notes
This project was intentionally completed using an Excel-only workflow to reflect common NGO and operational environments where Python or SQL may not always be available.

  # Methodology

## Data Sources
The dataset consolidates child-level information collected from schools, healthcare interactions, and community wellbeing assessments.

---

## Data Preparation Process

### Raw Data Review
- Verified column completeness
- Identified missing values and inconsistencies
- Reviewed data types and formats

### Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate and invalid records
- Standardised attendance rates as percentages
- Applied International-standard date formatting (YYYY/MM/DD)
- Handled missing values using:
  - Median imputation for numeric wellbeing indicators
  - Row removal where critical identifiers were missing
  - Retention of missing dates where absence itself was informative

### Data Modification (Feature Engineering)
Additional analytical fields were created to improve interpretability:
- **Age_Group:** Categorised age bands for comparison
- **Attendance_Category:** Grouped attendance levels (Low / Medium / High)
- **Checkup_Status:** Indicator of Checkup Completed and Not Completed

### Data Processing
- Created pivot tables for aggregation
- Generated pivot charts for exploratory analysis
- Prepared final datasets for reporting

---

## Key Insights
- Consistent attendance generally associates with higher well-being
- Significant missingness in key fields highlights reporting gaps
- Age group patterns show variation in checkup completion and wellness
- Outliers and data quality issues were documented and handled carefully

## Visualisations
See `/visuals/` folder for exported charts:
- `attendance_vs_wellbeing.png`
- `health_checkup_status.png`
- `wellbeing_vs_gender.png`
- `correlation_metrics.png`
- `age_group_vs_checkup_status.png`
- `country_pivot_summary.png`

  ## How to Reproduce
This is an Excel-native workflow:
1. Open the raw dataset in Excel
2. Clean using data validation and standardisation
3. Add feature columns using `IF` and conditional formulas
4. Build Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
5. Export visuals and include in portfolio

## Outputs
 `/data/cleaned/` — cleaned dataset  
`/data/modified/` — feature-enhanced dataset  
 `/data/processed/` — analysis-ready file  
 `/visuals/` — chart PNGs  
 `/portfolio/` — PDF & PPTX deliverables
